# Agricultural Yield Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing agricultural yield data using exploratory data
analysis and predicting crop yield with Multiple Linear Regression. The goal is to
identify key factors affecting yield and build an interpretable regression model.

## Dataset
- Agricultural yield related structured dataset
- Multiple numerical features influencing crop production
- Cleaned and prepared for analysis and modeling

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA is performed to:
- Understand feature distributions
- Analyze relationships between variables
- Identify trends and correlations
- Detect outliers and inconsistencies

## Data Visualization
Visualizations used in the analysis include:
- Histograms for feature distribution
- Scatter plots for relationship analysis
- Box plots for outlier detection
- Correlation heatmaps

## Machine Learning Model
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling where required
- Model training and prediction

## Model Evaluation
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Outcome
- Identification of key factors affecting agricultural yield
- Effective yield prediction using regression
- Data-driven insights supported by visualization
